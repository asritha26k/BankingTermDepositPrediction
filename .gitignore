# Machine Learning Models (Sensitive/Large Files)
# Generally, you should NOT commit large trained models (.pkl files) directly to Git.
# They can be large, change frequently, and should ideally be regenerated from code
# or stored in a dedicated model registry.
# If your 'full_pipeline.pkl' is relatively small and you prefer to version it
# alongside your code for simplicity, you can COMMENT OUT the line below.
# However, for best practice, keep it UNCOMMENTED (ignored).
